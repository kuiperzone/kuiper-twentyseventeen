== DECSRIPTION ==

KUIPER Twenty Seventeen is a highly customisable theme for WordPress. It is a child theme of the
enormously popular Twenty Seventeen but, unlike the parent, it allows you to extend the page width,
customize fonts and colors, and change how the "Featured Image" is displayed.

Out of the box, KUIPER Twenty Seventeen overrides the parent theme to default to websafe fonts.
However, you can easily specify links to web-font style sheets.

The theme allows you to:

o Extend the maximum page width.
o Fine control of over header and footer text using HTML.
o Include Open Graph meta tags in the header.
o Positioning of the logo image.
o Use either the parent "Featured Image" style, or a more traditional "standard look".
o Specify colors for individual elements, such as heading and links.
o Set fonts names and sizes for individual element types.
o Add a configurable "author bio" section for posts.
o Specify web-font URLs from the customizer.
